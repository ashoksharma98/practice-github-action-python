# Specify how many lines of tracebacks to show
# default is to show the full traceback, this limits it to the first 5 lines

# Use a different directory for test coverage or logs
# For example, to change the location of test report files:
# junitxml = result.xml

# If you want to enable debugging or additional output, you could also add:
# log_cli = true
# log_cli_level = INFO
